   software development, analytics, and computer security. Currently based in Sacramento, CA, I bring a 
   versatile and team-oriented approach to any dynamic business environment that values innovative problem-solving 
   and industry leadership.</p>

    with assembly languages, object-oriented programming, SQL, UNIX, React, and Spring Boot. 
    Additionally, I have solid experience in database management with SQL and the Microsoft package. 
    My technical skill set is complemented by my proficiency in Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum 
    and Kanban frameworks.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English, Farsi, and Pashto, which enhances my ability to work in diverse and multicultural 
  environments. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Computer Science from California
